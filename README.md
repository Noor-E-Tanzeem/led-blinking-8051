led-blinking-8051
Basic LED blinking project using 8051 microcontroller.

LED Blinking with 8051 Microcontroller:

This is a simple Embedded C program to blink an LED connected to the 8051 microcontroller using Port 2,Pin 0 (P2.0).
The program turns the LED ON and OFF in a loop with a delay.

Working Logic:

Turn ON LED → delay → Turn OFF LED → delay → Repeat
Delay is created using a simple loop


Note:
This project includes only the source code.
It hasn’t been simulated or tested on real hardware yet. 
Intended purely for learning and practice as part of my embedded systems journey.
